# sqlf
System-F implemented with SQL. Just for for crowd coding fun.

Something I plan to do in the near future, to :
- upgrade my SQL skills
- upgrade my calculus theory
- prototype an idea for collaborative software development (JIT coding...)

Prototype Implementation plan : 
- node.js
- sequelize.js

1. model a simply typed lambda calculus in SQL
2. REST API to translate to javascript, and evaluation in web
3. Add self doc + self test as part of language
4. provide app for people to implement missing part of code
5. write some search feature to fill in missing part of code automatically
6. write some code to attempt automated optimization of code...

Also, to consider asap : python implementation... in web or not...

First step : limit ourselves to lambda calculus.
We can get fancy after we get a proper usecase with it.
